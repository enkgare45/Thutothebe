            <p>When I  reflect on the actions of my previous self in the previous years, I realize how  much knowledge I have deprived myself. Aimlessly passing through the education  system and not giving a care in the world about what life had to offer beyond  the borders of my country. Yes, it&rsquo;s true, living abroad gives you a broader  perspective on life. But, reading is obtaining the view of what you probably could  not begin to fathom through the eyes of another. The broader the perspective  you have on life, the wiser you become and the more tools you have to tackle  lives challenges. I saw myself complete a book for the first time in my life  last year. I&rsquo;m also glad to say I read two more in completion and now on the  fourth. That alone has had a greater impact on me than the years I spent  watching series and movies. I still watch them, just not as much.            
            <p>So,  what exactly am I trying to bring to your attention?<br>
      Don&rsquo;t  settle for a life of mediocrity. Have goals, dreams and ambitions. Do things  out of your comfort zone-Things that challenge you, things that make your heart  race and make you feel like you're in a rollercoaster ride. STEP OUT OF YOUR  COMFORT ZONE! There's no growth in there. Only regrets, pain and a narrow  vision of life. If you want to improve your life, you got to make some changes  in your daily schedule: include a book to read, a skill to try out or some  activity that will build your personality as an individual. At the end of the  day, change is inevitable.</p>

   		  <h2 id="EN01">Society today: Are we loosing ourselves?</h2>
			<div class="article-info">Posted on <time datetime="2018-04-01">4 Jan</time> by <a href="Contributors.html#EN" rel="author"> Emmanuel Nkgare</a></div>


            <p> The great majority of us are required to live a life of constant duplicity. Our psychological and physical health is bound to be affected if day after day we consume that which we have proved to be unhealthy, if we say the opposite of what we feel, if we grovel before what we dislike, and rejoice at what brings others nothing but misfortune.<br></br>
Almost every human  wastes part of his life in attempts to display qualities he does not possess and to gain applause he cannot keep. The pouting selfies, the photoshopped retouches, heavy make up, group selfies or "welfies" if you may, and nudes for the extremists. I must say its incredulous how we have evolved to live life to document it... just so we could recite it to our peers. <br></br>
Its very easy to fall into this trap. The more content your brain subconsciously chunks from media, social or informative, the more vulnerable you become. Its sad to say that the very same thing we consider very important for progress is slowing us down. Our priorities have shifted drastically. We are now worried about very small pseudo-challenges like getting the right selfie angle so much we had to invent a selfie stick! While the factory that produced it rakes profits, the smoke they emitted pokes a hole in the ozone and we fall for the green sticker they put in thinking they are eco-friendly. What is happening to integrity people? Very few are still concerned with our primary challenges proving once and for all we are slaves to what we master.<br></br>
Now I'm no political scientist nor a conspiracy theorist but my hypothesis is that we are fed this 'junk' by design. If you are to survive this media apocalypse age, you will have to deny yourself some of these so-called privileges. Wake up fellow humans!

<h3 id="BF01">Procastination: Don't say you'll read this later...</h3>
<div class="article-info">Posted on <time datetime="2018-21-01">21 Jan</time> by <a href="Contributors.html#BF" rel="author"> Brilliant Fane</a></div>

    <p><div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 5px 0;"><iframe  width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1qt5pkTlWBY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
   
    
    <p>If asked, when was the last time you did your homework on time? or better yet, when was the last time you worked on a schedule and wrapped up everything on time? If you ask me, I cant even remember! why is that? why is it human nature to procrastinate? say you're given two weeks to complete an assignment but in those two weeks you watch TV, go partying, date-nights or do other stuff. And the day before you're supposed to submit the assignment, you're all over the place trying to get that paper done in a short period of time.Does this sound like you?
      If it does, read my two tricks to getting the work done... <br></br>
      <strong>1.  Prioritize-</strong> Draw up a list of all the important things you need to do. For example, a list of assignments due by the following week. Next thing is, narrow down that list to the most important thing(s) to do. The order of importance is based on the following: Deadline, the time needed to complete the task(this includes research time, brainstorming, writing drafts etc)and finally, your state of mind....we'll talk about this one later on.<br></br>
      It is highly recommended to have at most two things to do at a time especially when it comes to goals or things which demand a lot of FOCUS or require more reading, understanding, and research.
      <br></br>
      <strong>2. Discipline</strong>- This is the key to getting the work done. From businessmen, athletes to top scholars across the globe all of them attribute their success to this important ingredient.Without discipline, you can write down goals, new years resolutions and make plans for the future and still achieve nothing if you don't have the motivation, standards to get up and start doing the actual work.
     <br></br> <strong>How does discipline work?</strong>
      <br></br>Discipline is about raising your standards: be it in your academics, your job, your relationship or your business. It suffices when we have rituals... yes rituals not the creepy stuff you're thinking of. These rituals are, the things you do the same way at the same time every day, come rain or sunshine. For example, going to the gym three days a week without fail and maintaining consistency in your schedule. This only happens when " I should" becomes " I must" when there's no more room for excuses.<br></br>
      Wanna get that assignment done, have that sexy body or read two books a month? Prioritize and be disciplined!
